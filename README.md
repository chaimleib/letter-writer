# letter-writer

This script was originally created to prepare lots of thank you notes for printing.

It inserts the addressee info, renders to pdf, then joins all the letters into a single large pdf for easy printing.

This requires xelatex, pypdf2, django (for the templating engine), python3 and a Mac.
